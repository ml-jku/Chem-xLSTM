# Bio-xLSTM: Generative modeling, representation and in-context learning of biological and chemical sequences

This repository provides the code necessary to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper [Bio-xLSTM: Generative modeling, representation and in-context learning of biological and chemical sequences](TODO arxiv link). Experimental results are organized across the following repositories:

- [DNA-xLSTM](TODO link)
- [Prot-xLSTM](TODO link)
- [Chem-xLSTM](TODO link) (current repository) 

## Chem-xLSTM

Chem-xLSTM codebase is currently under construction and will be released soon.
